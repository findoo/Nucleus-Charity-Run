Plotting a simulated run over a year with Strava


### Archived! 

This app was used to track runners doing a challenge of running from Lands End to John O'Groats over a year. It would poll the strava API for a club, and show their progress on Google Maps, benchmarked against a fake 'pacer' runner. 

Sadly at some point Strava must have changed their API and it stopped working.
